This is a project implementing the network model of of electrically coupled cerebellar Golgi cells, as described in Vervaeke et al. 
**Rapid Desynchronization of an Electrically Coupled Interneuron Network 
with Sparse Excitatory Synaptic Input**, [Neuron 2010](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662731000512X).

The Golgi cell model is based on the abstract cell model in [Solinas et al., Frontiers in Neuroscience 2007](http://www.opensourcebrain.org/projects/4).
